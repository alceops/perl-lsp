# Troubleshooting Guide

Use this page when `perllsp` is installed but something still does not work:
the binary is not found, the server does not start, diagnostics are missing, or
the editor feels slow.

## Start With The Basics

```bash
perllsp --version
perllsp --health
perllsp --info
```

If those fail, fix the binary installation and `PATH` first. If they pass, the
problem is usually in editor integration, workspace roots, or a stale cache.

## The Server Will Not Start

1. Run the server in the foreground:

   ```bash
   perllsp --stdio
   ```

2. Turn on logging and read stderr:

   ```bash
   RUST_LOG=perl_lsp=debug perllsp --stdio
   ```

3. Check the editor's LSP log panel or buffer.

## The Editor Connects, But Nothing Happens

- Confirm the file type is Perl.
- Confirm the workspace root is the repository root, not a parent directory.
- Confirm the editor command really starts `perllsp --stdio`.

If the editor is using a helper extension or plugin, check its own logs too.

## Diagnostics Or Completions Are Missing

- Re-check the install with `perllsp --health`.
- Make sure the file is inside the indexed workspace.
- Restart the editor after changing language-server settings.
- If the project is large, try a smaller workspace root first.

## The Server Feels Slow

- Close unrelated files and trim the workspace to the project root.
- Disable any editor-side preview features that trigger extra refreshes.
- Compare behavior with a fresh shell session so stale environment state does
  not hide the problem.

## Module Resolution Problems

- Confirm the module lives under the workspace or configured include paths.
- Open the project root that contains the module tree, not just a subdirectory.
- If you are using vendored or local libraries, make sure the editor config
  points at them explicitly.

## Formatting Or Code Actions Are Missing

- Verify the editor has the relevant capability enabled.
- Check whether the current file actually has a Perl mode or file type.
- Inspect the LSP log for capability negotiation or request errors.

## Neovim Does Not Start `perllsp`

1. Confirm the binary works outside Neovim:

   ```bash
   perllsp --version
   perllsp --health
   perllsp --info
   ```

2. Confirm the buffer filetype in Neovim:

   ```vim
   :set filetype?
   ```

   It must be `perl`.

3. Confirm the LSP config is enabled:

   ```vim
   :checkhealth vim.lsp
   ```

4. For Neovim 0.11+, make sure config name and enable name match:

   ```lua
   vim.lsp.config('perllsp', { cmd = { 'perllsp', '--stdio' } })
   vim.lsp.enable('perllsp')
   ```

5. Use `perllsp --check path/to/file.pl` for manual diagnostics.
   Do not test stdio mode by piping unframed JSON.

## DAP Or Debugging Issues

If you are debugging with `perl-dap`, check the DAP guide:
[DAP_USER_GUIDE.md](../tutorials/DAP_USER_GUIDE.md).

## When To Escalate

Report an issue when you can include:

- `perllsp --version`
- `perllsp --health`
- the editor name and version
- the workspace layout
- the smallest code sample that reproduces the problem
