# Documentation Index

This page is the documentation front door for the `perl-lsp` workspace.

## Diataxis Quick Guide

Use this quick classifier when you are reading or adding docs:

| If your question sounds like... | Doc type | Primary docs folder |
|---|---|---|
| "Can you teach me this from scratch?" | Tutorial | `docs/tutorials/` |
| "How do I complete a specific task?" | How-to | `docs/how-to/` |
| "What is the exact behavior/contract?" | Reference | `docs/reference/` |
| "Why is it designed this way?" | Explanation | `docs/explanation/` |

Rule of thumb:
- Tutorials optimize for learning flow.
- How-to guides optimize for successful outcomes.
- Reference docs optimize for completeness and lookup speed.
- Explanation docs optimize for understanding tradeoffs and rationale.
