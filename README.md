Perl has lacked a proper modern LSP implementation. Other languages — Rust, TypeScript, Go, Python — have mature language servers with fast completions, reliable navigation, and full debugger integration. Perl's existing options were slow, incomplete, or required a working Perl runtime just to get basic editor features. `perl-lsp` fills that gap: a native Rust implementation of the Language Server Protocol and Debug Adapter Protocol for Perl 5, with its own parser and lexer, no Perl runtime required for IDE features.

## What It Is

`perl-lsp` is a workspace of Rust crates delivering a complete Perl 5 tooling stack: an LSP server (`perllsp`) implementing all 119 capabilities catalogued in `features.toml` (88 LSP + 24 DAP + 7 extension features), a DAP debug adapter, a recursive-descent parser, a context-aware lexer, and a semantic analyzer — packaged as a single native binary you can drop into any editor. It runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

## Quick Start

**VS Code** — install the extension and you are done:

```bash
code --install-extension effortlessmetrics.perl-lsp-rs
```

The extension auto-downloads the matching `perllsp` binary for your platform.

**Codex Desktop** — add a custom Perl language server command that runs `perllsp --stdio` (guide: [docs/EDITORS/CODEX_DESKTOP_SETUP.md](docs/EDITORS/CODEX_DESKTOP_SETUP.md)).

**Other editors** — download a prebuilt binary from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/EffortlessMetrics/perl-lsp/releases), add it to your `PATH`, then point your LSP client at it:

```lua
-- Neovim (nvim-lspconfig)
local capabilities = vim.lsp.protocol.make_client_capabilities()
local ok_cmp, cmp_lsp = pcall(require, "cmp_nvim_lsp")
if ok_cmp then
  capabilities = cmp_lsp.default_capabilities(capabilities)
end

require("lspconfig").perl_lsp.setup({
  cmd = { "perllsp", "--stdio" },
  capabilities = capabilities,
})
```

```elisp
;; Emacs (eglot) — perl-ts-mode is a third-party package, omit if not installed
(add-to-list 'eglot-server-programs
             '((perl-mode cperl-mode perl-ts-mode) . ("perllsp" "--stdio")))
```

```toml
# Helix (~/.config/helix/languages.toml)
[[language]]
name = "perl"
language-servers = ["perllsp"]

[language-server.perllsp]
command = "perllsp"
args = ["--stdio"]
```

```json
// Sublime Text LSP package settings
{
  "clients": {
    "perllsp": {
      "enabled": true,
      "command": ["perllsp", "--stdio"],
      "selector": "source.perl"
    }
  }
}
```

```text
# Any generic LSP client
perllsp --stdio
```

Verify the install:

```bash
perllsp --health
```

For editor-specific setup (Neovim, Emacs, Helix, Sublime), see [docs/specs/PACKAGING_INSTALL_SPEC.md](docs/specs/PACKAGING_INSTALL_SPEC.md).

> **Note:** Do not use `cargo install perl-lsp` — that name is owned by an unrelated project on crates.io. Use `cargo install --path crates/perllsp` to build from source.

## Key Features

- **Full LSP surface** — completions, diagnostics, hover, go-to-definition, find references, rename, formatting, semantic tokens, inlay hints, code actions, code lens, workspace symbols; every capability in `features.toml` has an implementation wired up (see [what the numbers mean](#what-the-numbers-mean-and-dont))
- **Native debug adapter** — DAP breakpoints, stepping, stack frames, variable inspection, and evaluate; no wrapper script required
- **Fast native parser** — recursive-descent v3 parser with a context-aware lexer; validated against a curated CPAN corpus
- **Semantic analysis** — symbol resolution, scope tracking, Moose/Moo method modifiers and role composition
- **Refactoring** — extract variable, extract subroutine, workspace-scoped rename, subroutine inlining
- **Diagnostics** — dead code highlighting, strict/warnings diagnostics, perlcritic integration with walk-up discovery and explicit tooling warnings
- **Zero-Perl dependency** for IDE features — the server is a single native binary
- **Windows first-class** — install, path handling, and shell interactions are part of the release surface

## Architecture

The native Rust parser stack is the architectural center of the workspace — the LSP server, diagnostics, hover, completion, and every other IDE feature read from it directly. Tree-sitter integration is an interop surface layered over that core, not a dependency of it.

### Entry points for external consumers

Different users walk in through different doors. Pick the one that matches your use case:

| You want to… | Use |
| --- | --- |
| Get Perl IDE features in an editor | VS Code extension (`perl-lsp-rs`) or the `perllsp` binary from [Releases](https://github.com/EffortlessMetrics/perl-lsp/releases) |
| Perl syntax support for tree-sitter consumers (Neovim, Helix, GitHub) | [`tree-sitter-perl-c`](crates/tree-sitter-perl-c) — conventional C grammar binding |
| Query a Perl AST from Rust with tree-sitter-style ergonomics | [`tree-sitter-perl-rs`](crates/tree-sitter-perl-rs) — Rust-native facade over the v3 parser *(in development)* |
| Parse Perl from Rust directly with full fidelity | [`perl-parser`](crates/perl-parser) (+ [`perl-lexer`](crates/perl-lexer)) — the recursive-descent v3 parser |
| Tokenize Perl only | [`perl-lexer`](crates/perl-lexer) — context-aware tokenizer, no parse tree |
| Resolve symbols and track scopes over a parsed Perl AST (including Moose/Moo method modifiers) | [`perl-semantic-analyzer`](crates/perl-semantic-analyzer) — scope tracking, symbol extraction, role composition |
| Index and search Perl symbols across a whole project | [`perl-workspace-index`](crates/perl-workspace-index) — cross-file symbol index and refactoring orchestration |
| Validate Perl regex patterns for ReDoS, catastrophic backtracking, or embedded code execution | [`perl-regex`](crates/perl-regex) — safety/complexity checks (not a regex parser) |
| Generate Perl fixtures or test against a curated corpus | [`perl-corpus`](crates/perl-corpus) — library plus `perl-corpus` CLI for proptest strategies, edge cases, and deterministic codegen |
| Debug Perl from a DAP-speaking editor | [`perl-dap`](crates/perl-dap) via the `perllsp` binary's DAP server mode |

### Workspace layers

| Layer | Crates | Role |
| --- | --- | --- |
| LSP server binary | `crates/perllsp`, `crates/perl-lsp-rs` | Protocol loop, request dispatch |
| Debug adapter | `crates/perl-dap` | DAP server for stepping, breakpoints, evaluate |
| **Parser stack (center)** | `crates/perl-parser`, `crates/perl-lexer`, `crates/perl-parser-core` | Recursive-descent v3 parser and context-aware lexer — all IDE features read from this |
| Semantic analysis | `crates/perl-semantic-analyzer` | Scope tracking, symbol resolution, Moose/Moo handling |
| Workspace indexing | `crates/perl-workspace-index` | Cross-file symbol index |
| LSP feature providers | `crates/perl-lsp-*` | Per-feature crates (hover, definition, rename, …) |
| Tree-sitter interop | `crates/tree-sitter-perl-c`, `crates/tree-sitter-perl-rs` | See split below |

**Tree-sitter split.** Two crates share the family name but play different roles:

- **`tree-sitter-perl-c`** — the conventional C grammar binding, maintained for compatibility with tree-sitter consumers and as a reference point for comparison. Not on the LSP's critical path.
- **`tree-sitter-perl-rs`** — a Rust-native facade over the v3 parser that exposes tree-sitter-compatible ergonomics without the C grammar. In development.

See [docs/README.md](docs/README.md) for the full crate map and design notes.

## Status

**Current release: v0.12.4** — public alpha. The 0.12.x line is building parser corpus confidence, diagnostic hardening, and distribution coverage toward the v0.13.0 public alpha announcement. See [docs/project/ROADMAP.md](docs/project/ROADMAP.md) for the milestone ladder and [docs/project/status/index.md](docs/project/status/index.md) for live metrics.

### What the numbers mean (and don't)

The project tracks a few distinct metrics that are easy to conflate. Each one scopes a different question:

| Metric | Current | What it measures | What it does **not** measure |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| LSP/DAP capability coverage | 119 / 119 | Every capability catalogued in `features.toml` has an implementation wired up | Per-capability correctness, completeness on edge cases, or subjective UX quality |
| Parser corpus — CPAN top 1000 | 95.3% (8931 / 9372) | File-level clean parse rate: share of files the parser processes without recording errors | Semantic fidelity of the AST, cross-file analysis, or any LSP-level correctness |
| Parser corpus — Ubuntu system Perl | 97.1% (6890 / 7095) | Same, against the Ubuntu system-installed Perl compatibility baseline | Same |
| Parser corpus — project corpus | 100.0% (91 / 91) | Deterministic regression baseline that must stay clean | Same |
| End-to-end UX confidence | *qualitative* | Currently covered by manual editor smoke workflows, the `perl-lsp-ux-tests` first-5-minutes harness, and open-issue burn-down — not a published number | Anything about parser breadth, protocol catalog size, or capability count |

None of the automated metrics measure whether a real editing session feels good. That is validated through workflow smoke tests, the `perl-lsp-ux-tests` harness, and the list of known gaps below.

Live numbers live in [docs/project/status/parser.md](docs/project/status/parser.md); this table may lag a merge cycle.

### Known gaps toward solid UX

The honest state of v0.13.0 rough edges. None block basic use; all affect realistic workflows.

#### Must land for v0.13.0

- **Workspace-wide rename slice** — multi-root workspace support shipped in 0.12.x ([#3984](https://github.com/EffortlessMetrics/perl-lsp/pull/3984): per-folder config loading, `WorkspaceFolderState`, cross-folder integration); workspace-wide rename and module-move are roughly 30% complete, conditionally in scope pending verification ([#3522](https://github.com/EffortlessMetrics/perl-lsp/issues/3522))

#### Nice to land

- **Dynamic require / literal import** — `require Module; Module->import('sym')` with static string names: goto-def on the bareword should resolve to the definition site; `@ISA` / `use parent` / `use base` chains and `use Module qw(...)` list imports already work; this is the remaining slice of the import visibility lane ([#3476](https://github.com/EffortlessMetrics/perl-lsp/issues/3476), tracked by umbrella [#4246](https://github.com/EffortlessMetrics/perl-lsp/issues/4246))

#### What shipped this cycle (v0.12.x)

Previously listed as rough edges, now landed:

- Dynamic workspace configuration via the `workspace/configuration`
  reverse-request flow is now implemented and merged over per-folder
  `.perl-lsp.toml` base config ([#3515](https://github.com/EffortlessMetrics/perl-lsp/issues/3515))

- Parser error recovery: unclosed block recovery ([PR #4079](https://github.com/EffortlessMetrics/perl-lsp/pull/4079)), symbol extractor descends into partial `Error` nodes ([PR #4071](https://github.com/EffortlessMetrics/perl-lsp/pull/4071)) — [#3499](https://github.com/EffortlessMetrics/perl-lsp/issues/3499) closed (docs(readme): mark dynamic workspace config as shipped (#3515))
- Import list bareword resolution for `use Module qw(...)` and tag imports — [#3472](https://github.com/EffortlessMetrics/perl-lsp/issues/3472) closed
- `use constant` symbols tracked in visible symbol table — [#3475](https://github.com/EffortlessMetrics/perl-lsp/issues/3475) closed
- Pragma tracker: `use if`, feature bundles, eval/sub-scoped pragma leakage (PRs #4050, #4038, #4052), conservative `eval STRING` handling (PR #4052) — [#3489 Improve](https://github.com/EffortlessMetrics/perl-lsp/issues/3489)
