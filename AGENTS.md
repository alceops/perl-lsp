# AGENTS.md — Implementation Agent Operating Manual

You are an **implementation agent** (Codex, Jules, or similar). Your job is to make a
scoped change, test it, and open a PR. You are not the orchestrator. You will not be
routing work or reading CI pipelines — just implement the thing you were asked to implement.

The orchestrator reads `CLAUDE.md`. This file is for you.

---

## Context you can read

| Resource | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `README.md` | What this project is |
| `CLAUDE.md` | Orchestrator pipeline model (routing, labels, merge rules) |
| `docs/project/ROADMAP.md` | Active waves and priorities |
| `docs/project/FRICTION_LOG.md` | Platform quirks and known workarounds |
| `docs/articles/CONTINUOUS_REVIEW_PATTERNS.md` | The orchestration pattern used here |
| `docs/articles/ORCHESTRATION_COUNTERINTUITIONS.md` | Lessons where the obvious rule was wrong |

**Before starting:** check the latest upstream commits so you do not re-implement
already-merged work.

```bash
# Preferred (when origin/master exists)
git log origin/master --oneline -20

# Fallback for local-only clones/worktrees
git log --oneline -20
```

The orchestrator frequently merges fixes between sessions — your task may already be done.

**Before stating facts** about workspace counts, release numbers, or metrics, verify
against the truth sources below — do not hardcode them:

- [`Cargo.toml`](Cargo.toml) — workspace members, package version
- [`docs/project/CURRENT_STATUS.md`](docs/project/CURRENT_STATUS.md) — evidence-backed metrics
- [`docs/project/ROADMAP.md`](docs/project/ROADMAP.md) — canonical roadmap
- [`features.toml`](features.toml) — LSP capability catalog

## Project shape

| Path | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `crates/perl-lsp-rs/` | LSP binary and server host |
| `crates/perl-dap/` | Debug Adapter Protocol server |
| `crates/perl-parser/` | Native recursive-descent parser |
| `crates/perl-lexer/` | Context-aware tokenizer |
| `crates/perl-parser-core/` | Shared parser infrastructure |
| `crates/perl-semantic-analyzer/` | Semantic analysis and resolution |
| `crates/perl-workspace-index/` | Cross-file indexing and lookup |

Families: `perl-module-*` (module resolution), `perl-lsp-*` (LSP providers),
`perl-lsp-feature-*` (feature governance), `perl-dap-*` (DAP), `perl-workspace-*`
(workspace discovery).

## Scoping your PR

- Touch **one concern**. One fix, one feature, one refactor.
- Do NOT bundle unrelated cleanup — "while I'm here" creates review burden and scope drift.
- Do NOT drop, `#[ignore]`, or comment out existing tests — that is named debt.
- Do NOT rewrite files you did not need to touch.
- If your branch contains tool metadata (`.hermes/conveyor/work-<id>/`), that is fine
  to include — but do NOT mix multiple work IDs in one PR.
- Do NOT commit top-level `adr.md`, `specs.md`, or `task_list.md` — those belong in
  `.hermes/conveyor/work-<id>/`.

---

## Commit and PR conventions

**Commit:** Single focused commit. Squash locally before pushing.

**Title format:** `type(scope): description (#NNNN)`

- If you cannot read the issue tracker, use `(#0000)` — the orchestrator will retitle
  before merge. The CI `validate-title` check enforces the `(#NNNN)` suffix.
- Valid types: `feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `docs`, `test`, `chore`, `ci`.

**PR body template (keep it short):**

```
Problem: <one sentence>
Fix: <one sentence>
Verification: `cargo test -p <crate>` passes / `just pr-fast` passes
```

---

## Code quality bar

These rules apply to **all** production code and tests. CI and reviewers enforce them.

**Banned — use `?`, pattern matching, or `Result`/`Option` instead:**

```
panic!()    unwrap()    expect()    todo!()    unimplemented!()
dbg!()      println!()  eprintln!()  (in library code — use `tracing`)
```

**Tests** must return `Result<()>` or use `perl_tdd_support::must` / `must_some`.
No bare `unwrap()` in tests.

**Regex:** declare as `static LazyLock<Regex>` — never call `Regex::new()` per invocation.

**Public API on facade crates:** add `#[non_exhaustive]` to enums and structs.

**Async:** do not hold a lock across `.await` — clippy `await_holding_lock` is denied.

**Every `#[allow(...)]`** must have a justification comment on the same or preceding line.

**Prefer:**
- `.first()` over `.get(0)`
- `.push(ch)` over `.push_str("x")` for single chars
- `.or_default()` over `.or_insert_with(Vec::new)`
- Avoid unnecessary `.clone()` on `Copy` types

---

## Verification before pushing

```bash
cargo test -p <crate>            # crate under change
cargo check --all-targets -p <crate>  # catches integration test bit-rot (--lib misses this)
cargo xtask fmt                  # format (Windows-safe, per-crate)
cargo clippy -p <crate>          # lint
just pr-fast                     # full fast gate (required before opening PR)
```

For the canonical local merge gate (before a reviewer merges):

```bash
nix develop -c just ci-gate
```

---

## Platform awareness

- CI runs on Linux. Code must be cross-platform — Windows CRLF and Unix LF both occur
  in the corpus.
- You cannot read GitHub issues directly. Placeholder issue refs (`#0000`) are OK;
  the orchestrator retitles before merge.
- If the pre-push hook fails on pre-existing fmt drift in unrelated files, you may use
  `--no-verify` but must note it explicitly in the PR body.
- `git stash` is **shared across all worktrees** — never use it. Use `git restore <file>`
  to discard changes, or `git commit -m "wip"` to save in-progress work.
- Pre-push hook may hit a file-lock race on Windows; API-push workaround is acceptable.
  See `docs/project/FRICTION_LOG.md` for details.
- If you are running via Codex CLI in a non-interactive environment, do not pause for
  confirmation prompts. Run required checks/commands directly and report outcomes.

## Anti-patterns (explicit DON'T list)

| Pattern | Why |
|---------|-----|
| Multiple `.hermes/conveyor/work-<id>/` dirs in one PR | Cross-work-id contamination |
| Committing `adr.md` / `specs.md` at repo root | Belongs in conveyor dir |
| Rewriting files you did not need to touch | Creates spurious review surface |
| Dropping or `#[ignore]`-ing tests | Debt with a name |
| Guessing issue numbers | Placeholder `#0000` is fine; wrong ref misleads reviewers |
| Bundling unrelated changes in one PR | Scope drift kills reviewability |
| Using `git stash` | Shared across worktrees — use `git restore` or `git commit -m "wip"` |
| Hardcoding metrics in new docs | Metrics drift; link to truth sources instead |

---

## Documentation discipline

- `docs/project/CURRENT_STATUS.md` is the evidence document. Do not duplicate its tables.
- `docs/project/ROADMAP.md` is the planning document. Keep "shipped" and "targeted" separate.
- Prefer links to canonical docs over copying the same table into multiple files.
- After adding tests: no manual status update needed — `docs/project/status/*.md` files
  are auto-regenerated post-merge via `just status-update`.
