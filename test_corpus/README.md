# Test Corpus - Gap Coverage

This directory contains test files that cover gaps in the original test corpus. These files test real-world Perl features that were missing from the initial test suite.

## File Descriptions

### Critical Coverage Gaps

1. **source_filters.pl** - Source filters that modify code at compile time (Filter::Simple, Filter::Util::Call)
2. **xs_inline_ffi.pl** - XS modules, Inline::C, and FFI integration patterns
3. **modern_perl_features.pl** - Perl 5.34-5.38 features (signatures, try/catch, builtin::, class/field)
4. **advanced_regex.pl** - Complex regex patterns (recursive, code blocks, Unicode properties)

### Parser Boundary Tests

5. **data_end_sections.pl** - `__DATA__` section handling
6. **end_section.pl** - `__END__` section handling  
7. **packages_versions.pl** - Versioned packages and multi-package files
8. **legacy_syntax.pl** - Legacy Perl syntax (bareword filehandles, indirect object, old package separator)
9. **continue_redo_statements.pl** - Loop control statements (next/redo/continue blocks)
10. **format_statements.pl** - Legacy format statements and picture lines
11. **glob_expressions.pl** - Glob operators and angle bracket patterns
12. **tie_interface.pl** - Tie/untie interface coverage for scalars, arrays, hashes, handles
13. **parser_stress_cases.pl** - Ambiguity and boundedness cases (slash vs regex, hash vs block, indirect objects, deep nesting, complex delimiters, multiple heredocs)
14. **regex_timeout_hardening.pl** - Timeout-risk regex constructs (branch-reset groups, variable-length lookbehind, code assertions, deferred patterns)
15. **caller_context_comprehensive.pl** - caller()/wantarray introspection, tail-call `goto &sub`, and context-sensitive wrapper patterns

## Running Tests

```bash
# Run all corpus gap tests
cargo test corpus_gap_tests

# Run with v3 parser only
cargo test corpus_gap_tests --features v3-parser

# Run with LSP tests
cargo test corpus_gap_tests --features lsp

# Run benchmarks
cargo test bench_corpus_files --ignored --release
```

## Expected Behavior

For each test file, the parser should:
1. **Not crash or hang** - Even on complex/unusual syntax
2. **Produce an AST** - May have error nodes but should have structure
3. **Handle boundaries** - Stop parsing at `__DATA__`/`__END__`
4. **Extract symbols** - Find packages, subs, and other declarations

For LSP, additionally:
1. **Return diagnostics quickly** - No timeouts even on complex files
2. **Provide document symbols** - All packages and subroutines listed
3. **Support folding** - Reasonable folding ranges for blocks
4. **No false diagnostics** - Don't report errors in DATA sections or after filters

## Coverage Improvements

These tests improve coverage from ~95% to approaching 100% of real-world Perl syntax:

- **Before**: Missing XS, filters, modern features, complex regex
- **After**: Comprehensive coverage including CPAN module patterns

## Known Limitations

Some features cannot be fully supported without runtime execution:
- Source filter transformations (we parse the pre-filter code)
- XS function implementations (we see stubs only)
- BEGIN block side effects (compile-time execution)

However, the parser should handle these gracefully without errors.
